Domain Names for Containers

For convenience, it is possible to automatically map domain names to your
containers' IP addresses.  This allows connecting to them from the host machine
using names like mycontainer.lxc, rather than having to keep track of their
numeric addresses.

First, uncomment the following line in the host's /etc/default/lxc-net file:

LXC_DOMAIN="lxc"

Next, add the following line to the host's dnsmasq configuration file:

server=/lxc/10.0.3.1

On Debian-based systems running NetworkManager, such as Ubuntu desktops, add
that line to /etc/NetworkManager/dnsmasq.d/lxc.conf (or a similarly-named file
in the same directory).  On systems without NetworkManager, add it to
/etc/dnsmasq.conf instead.  You may have to create the file yourself.

Finally, restart the lxc-net service, and the network-manager service if it is
running on your system:  (These commands must be run as root.)

invoke-rc.d lxc-net restart
invoke-rc.d network-manager restart
